# Until I Know

Game showcased [here](https://sh1kha.itch.io/untill-i-know)

You’re dead. You just don’t know why.

In Until I Know, you play as the lingering ghost of a game developer who vanished without warning. Trapped in a quiet neighborhood frozen in time, you must uncover the truth behind your disappearance—not through clues or corpses, but through the fractured minds of those you left behind.

Explore the hidden thoughts of five neighbors, each haunted by their own emotional battles. Dive into their memories through symbolic “Mind Duels”—a blend of dialogue, metaphor, and a rhythm-based timing mini-game where every beat strikes at something deeper.

As you piece together the fragments they couldn’t say, you’ll face not just what happened… but why it still hurts.
