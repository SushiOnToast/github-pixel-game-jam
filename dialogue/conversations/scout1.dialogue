Scout 1: If I was a frog... I’d totally live riiiiight there. Under that lily pad.
Scout 1: Or maybe in the muddy bit... bleh, too squishy.
Scout 1: Wonder if frogs get bored of just hopping all day. Do they, like, get tired too?
Scout 1: Maybe they have secret frog meetings when no one's looking.
Scout 1: "Ribbit, Agenda item one: avoid the tall kid who throws rocks."
Scout 1: Heh, I’d be the frog boss. Ribbit boss... gotta keep everything just right.
Scout 1: Wish I could jump like that. Over the whole pond, whoosh!
Scout 1: But the water feels weird today, kinda quiet. Like it’s holding its breath.
Scout 1: Huh, wonder why... maybe even frogs need a break sometimes, huh?
