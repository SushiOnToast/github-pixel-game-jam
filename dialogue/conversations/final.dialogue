: The wind is still now.  
: The voices are quiet.  
: You stand alone, yet no longer lost.  

: Their memories linger—not as chains, but as threads.  
: Threads of guilt... silence... sorrow.  
: But also of care. Of things left unsaid, but felt.  

: You saw them. And they saw you.  
: Even if it was too late to say it out loud.  

: There wasn’t one moment that broke you.  
: Just a thousand tiny ones no one noticed.  

: And one day, you didn’t log in.  
: One day, you didn’t reply.  
: One day, you were gone.  

: But you’re still here.  
: A ghost, maybe.  
: A memory, definitely.  

: It’s okay.  
: To not have the answers.  
: To not be okay.  
: To still be figuring it out.

: Until I know.  
: Until I’m ready to leave.  
: I’ll keep remembering.  
: I’ll keep playing.  
: I’ll keep trying.

: And maybe one day, I’ll forgive myself for all the mistakes that didn't matter.
