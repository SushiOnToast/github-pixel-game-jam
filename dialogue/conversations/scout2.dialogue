Scout 2: Finally! I got the cart to myself!
Scout 2: Okay... blue raspberry, cherry, or the toothpaste one?
Scout 2: Ugh, I always pick the toothpaste one by accident! Why does mint even exist in popsicles?!
Scout 2: Maybe today's the day I go wild - two flavours at once.
Scout 2: It's weird though. Usually there's a line. Even grumpy Adam complains about the prices.
Scout 2: But today, it's just me...
Scout 2: Not that I mind! More popsicles for Scout 2!
Scout 2: ...Still feels kinda quiet.
Scout 2: Maybe I'll save one in case someone shows up.
